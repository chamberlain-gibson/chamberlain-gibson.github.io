## Project description

This project was to create a game of Hangman. 

There is a total of 5 parts:
1. Loading and processing phrases
2. Print out the phrase with an underscore for each unguessed letter.
3. Select a random phrase based on the difficulty level
4. The game loop
5. Allow the user to play multiple times per run.

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```
Download Ming-GW for Visual Studio Code/Personal Terminal 

$g++ -o hangman hangman.cpp

$./hangman

```

## UI Design

Everything should prompt the user properly and the user should be able to play the game as many times as their heart desires.
