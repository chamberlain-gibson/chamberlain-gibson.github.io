1. Discuss one challenge you overcame during your academic development. What was the challenge, was it technical, nontechnical, or both, and how did you overcome it?
<li>The primary challenge I overcame throughout my entire academic career was believing in myself academically. In which case, I have a difficult time trusting that I know the material. 
I examined and practiced the subject only to fall short on exams because I did not believe I had identified the material. This was combined with a lot of testing anxieties. I did not believe that I genuinely comprehended the information or could be successful at all because I kept failing. This is a non-technical challenge because it is not a skill that is necessarily taught. It is something that is gained over time. To continuously overcome this challenge is to begin with trusting that I know the material and I can succeed. This trust must begin with surrounding myself with like-minded people and having an encouraging accountability partner. Some examples of this are having a study group who know this issue and are willing to help. Having a close relative check on me as an accountability partner helps with achieving trust in myself so that I can believe in myself.</li>

2. Discuss a situation where you worked with a team. How would you describe yourself as a teammate? Where can you improve your team skills?
<li>Currently, I am a part of a team for my System Analysis and Software Design class. This class is meant to assist students use real-world methods between developers and clientele in an academic setting. In this team, we are communicating every day on tasks and discussing the design elements we would like to produce that is best suited for the client. From the design elements we are implementing a system based on requests from the client. As a teammate I am very vocal on meeting deadlines and adding creative ideas to the design process that is going to help the client. I make sure I am providing as much work necessary to meet the clientâ€™s requirements and support everyone to achieve this. I provide constructive criticism to certain items that are not meeting the requirements and use examples to demonstrate ways of improving this item. I can improve my team skills by allowing team members to take on some of the workload and delegate different things that other members can do. I always do to much in a team because I want to help the team in any possible way and working diligently to provide an outstanding product.</li>

3. What type of career in CS do you believe you are most suited for? Why this field and not another?
<li> Working for federal level cyber security teams is a career I believe I am suited for because I am trustworthy enough to keep this line of work secret and I have the courage to help as many people as possible. Though it's a massive undertaking and quite demanding, I can contribute to the best of my ability to be a useful member. This field is challenging and improving with technology to assess new threats daily. Taking on challenges is a part of the process in any given career field, which is something I want in my career. I always want to be challenged and improve my skills to assess these new threats. Another field that people have suggested is teaching cyber security principles in a public school or intelligence company. I appreciate educating others about the fundamentals of cyber security. I want to challenge myself by utilizing my knowledge and talents to solve a bigger issue.</li>

4.	What professional organizations would you like to join? What professional development would you like to be a part of in the next five years?
<li>Any professional organization I would like to join with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), FBI, or Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on their Cyber Security programs. These organizations provide training and challenges in response to threats. These organizations have tasks forces and sectors that are concerned with helping people on the cyber platform. I would like to use my skills and knowledge to be an addition to helping others.</li>

5.	What are the ways you can use the skills you have learned in CS to serve your community?
<li>Some ways I have used skills that I have learned in cyber security to serve my community is by helping people become more aware of some key aspects that affect information or internet security. I have already started working in the community by helping my church and friends with issues pertaining to something that comes up, and they need help to understand the issue to even address it. From finding the root of the issue, I can teach anyone how to avoid it from happening again. Being able to teach someone to the point that they understand is a great way of better understanding a subject and can lead to more research for that subject. I have some experience of teaching some students to help their understanding and appreciation of the subject better.</li>
